# Kaidoku
 Base64 decoder bot, used by SoundBytes PH

# Setup
If [Houshou Marine](https://github.com/Yuuhei/Houshou-Marine-SBPH-Bot)'s dependencies are already setup, no need to install additional dependencies.


Change `allowed_channel_id = YOUR_CHANNEL_ID` to your preffered channel where the bot responds.

Add token in `kaidoku.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')`.

That's it.
